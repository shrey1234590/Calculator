<Overview>
The goal of this project is to build a fully functional calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on a web browser. The calculator interface consists of buttons for numbers, operators, and a display screen to show input and results.

<Technologies Used> 
1.HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the calculator's layout. It defines the elements such as buttons for numbers and operators, and a display area to show input and output.

2.CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is utilized for styling the calculator's visual appearance. This includes defining colors, fonts, button sizes, spacing, and overall layout design. CSS Grid or Flexbox can be employed for arranging the buttons in a grid-like format that adapts to different screen sizes.

3.JavaScript
JavaScript is the core language for implementing the calculator’s functionality. It handles user interactions, such as clicking on buttons to input numbers and operators. JavaScript also performs the calculations based on user input and updates the display screen accordingly. Key JavaScript concepts utilized include event handling, DOM manipulation (updating HTML elements dynamically), and implementing basic arithmetic operations programmatically.

<Key Features>
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and operators (+, -, *, /).
Input Handling: Captures user input through button clicks and updates the display area in real-time.
Calculation Logic: Implements logic to handle sequential operations (e.g., performing calculations step-by-step) and ensures accurate results.
Error Handling: Includes mechanisms to handle division by zero and other potential errors, displaying meaningful messages to the user.
Clear Functionality: Offers a clear button to reset the calculator’s display and start over.
